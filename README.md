# vc-operator

A Kubernetes operator that manages Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for services in
[FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/)-ecosystem deployments. It obtains credentials
via [OID4VCI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html)
(OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance), stores them as Kubernetes Secrets,
and automatically renews them before expiry.

## Architecture

```
                          +-----------------------+
                          |   Kubernetes Cluster  |
                          |                       |

 +------------------+     |  +-------+--------+   |     +-------------------+
                          |          |             |

                          |          v             |
                          |  +----------------+   |     +-------------------+
                          |  | Secrets        |<--|---->| Service Pods      |
                          |  | (credentials)  |   |     | (consume creds)   |
                          |  +----------------+   |     +-------------------+
                          +-----------------------+
```

**How it works:**

1. A cluster admin creates a `CredentialIssuer` resource pointing to an OID4VCI
   issuer (e.g., Keycloak) and a `VerifiableCredentialRequest` specifying the
   credential type needed.
2. The operator discovers the issuer's OID4VCI metadata, authenticates using
   client credentials from a referenced Secret, and obtains a Verifiable
   Credential.
3. The credential is stored in a Kubernetes Secret (or another pluggable backend).
4. The operator monitors credential expiry and automatically renews credentials
   before they expire, ensuring uninterrupted service operation.

## Features

- **OID4VCI Protocol Support** -- Full OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance
  flow including metadata discovery, token acquisition, and credential issuance.
- **Automatic Renewal** -- Credentials are renewed before expiry based on
  configurable `renewBefore` duration.
- **Pluggable Storage** -- Credentials are stored via a `CredentialStore`
  interface. Kubernetes Secrets is the default backend; alternative backends
  (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) can be added.
- **Credential Rotation Safety** -- Previous credential is retained alongside the
  new one during rotation, giving consuming services a grace period.
- **Prometheus Metrics** -- Built-in metrics for credentials issued, renewed,
  errors, and time-to-expiry.
- **Holder Identity Binding** -- Optionally bind credentials to a specific holder
  identity via proof-of-possession JWTs. Supports both JWK-based and DID-based
  binding.
- **Keycloak Support** -- First-class support for Keycloak as an OID4VCI issuer.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+ (for building from source)
- Docker 17.03+
- kubectl v1.26+
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.26+ cluster
- An OID4VCI-compatible credential issuer (e.g., Keycloak with VC support)

### Install with Helm

```bash
# Add the Helm chart (or install from local source)
helm install vc-operator ./charts/vc-operator \
  --namespace vc-operator-system \
  --create-namespace
```

### Install with Kustomize

```bash
# Install CRDs
make install

# Deploy the operator
make deploy IMG=ghcr.io/wistefan/vc-operator:latest
```

### Create Your First Credential

**1. Create an authentication Secret** with the client credentials for your
OID4VCI issuer:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: keycloak-vc-credentials
type: Opaque
stringData:
  client_id: "my-vc-client"
  client_secret: "my-client-secret"
```

**2. Create a CredentialIssuer** pointing to your OID4VCI issuer:

```yaml
apiVersion: vc.vc-operator.io/v1alpha1
kind: CredentialIssuer
metadata:
  name: my-keycloak-issuer
spec:
  issuerURL: "https://keycloak.example.com/realms/vc-issuer"
  issuerType: keycloak
  authSecretRef:
    name: keycloak-vc-credentials
```

**3. Create a VerifiableCredentialRequest** to obtain a credential:

```yaml
apiVersion: vc.vc-operator.io/v1alpha1
kind: VerifiableCredentialRequest
metadata:
  name: my-service-credential
spec:
  issuerRef:
    name: my-keycloak-issuer
  credentialType: "VerifiableCredential"
  format: jwt_vc_json
  targetSecretRef:
    name: my-service-vc
    key: credential
  renewBefore: 10m
```

**4. Verify** the credential was obtained:

```bash
# Check the VerifiableCredentialRequest status
kubectl get verifiablecredentialrequests
# NAME                    ISSUER               CREDENTIAL TYPE        FORMAT        READY   EXPIRY   RENEWALS   AGE
# my-service-credential   my-keycloak-issuer   VerifiableCredential   jwt_vc_json   True    ...      0          1m

# Check the generated Secret
kubectl get secret my-service-vc -o jsonpath='{.data.credential}' | base64 -d
```

### Holder Identity Binding (Optional)

By default, credentials are issued without being bound to a specific holder. To
bind a credential to a holder identity, provide a holder key and optionally a DID.

**1. Generate an ECDSA P-256 key pair:**

```bash
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out holder-key.pem
```

**2. Create a Secret with the holder key:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-holder-key
type: Opaque
data:
  key.pem: <base64-encoded contents of holder-key.pem>
```

**3. Reference the key in the VerifiableCredentialRequest:**

```yaml
apiVersion: vc.vc-operator.io/v1alpha1
kind: VerifiableCredentialRequest
metadata:
  name: my-service-credential
spec:
  issuerRef:
    name: my-keycloak-issuer
  credentialType: "VerifiableCredential"
  format: jwt_vc_json
  targetSecretRef:
    name: my-service-vc
    key: credential
  # Bind to the holder's key (JWK binding)
  holderKeyRef:
    name: my-holder-key
  # Optional: use a DID instead of raw JWK in the proof
  # holderDID: "did:key:zDnaerDaTF5BXEavCrfRZEk316dpbLsfPDZ3WJ5hRTPFU2169"
```

When `holderKeyRef` is set, the operator signs a proof-of-possession JWT with the
holder's private key and includes it in the credential request. The issuer then
binds the issued credential to that key.

If `holderDID` is also set, the proof JWT uses a `kid` header with the DID URL
instead of embedding the full JWK public key. This enables DID-based holder
binding. The DID must resolve to the public key corresponding to the private key
in the referenced Secret.

## CRD Reference

## Troubleshooting

### CredentialIssuer stays in `Ready=False`

**Symptom:** The `CredentialIssuer` resource does not reach `Ready=True`.

**Check issuer connectivity:**
```bash
kubectl describe credentialissuer <name>
```

Look at the `Conditions` section for the reason:

| Reason | Cause | Resolution |
|--------|-------|------------|
| `MetadataFetchFailed` | Cannot reach the issuer URL or metadata endpoint returned an error. | Verify the `issuerURL` is correct and accessible from the cluster. Check network policies and DNS. |
| `AuthSecretNotFound` | The referenced authentication Secret does not exist. | Create the Secret with the correct name in the same namespace. |
| `AuthSecretInvalid` | The Secret is missing required keys. | Ensure the Secret has `client_id` and `client_secret` (or `pre_authorized_code`) keys. |

### VerifiableCredentialRequest stays in `Ready=False`

**Symptom:** The credential request does not succeed.

```bash
kubectl describe verifiablecredentialrequest <name>
```

| Reason | Cause | Resolution |
|--------|-------|------------|
| `IssuerNotFound` | The referenced `CredentialIssuer` does not exist. | Create the `CredentialIssuer` resource first, or fix the `issuerRef.name`. |
| `IssuerNotReady` | The referenced `CredentialIssuer` is not yet `Ready`. | Wait for the issuer to become ready, or check its status for errors. |
| `TokenRequestFailed` | Failed to obtain an access token from the issuer. | Verify client credentials are correct. Check issuer logs. |
| `CredentialRequestFailed` | The credential issuance request was rejected. | Verify the `credentialType` is supported by the issuer. Check the issuer's `credential_configurations_supported`. |
| `StorageFailed` | Failed to create or update the target Secret. | Check RBAC permissions. Ensure no conflicting Secret exists with different ownership. |
| `HolderKeyInvalid` | The `holderKeyRef` Secret is missing, contains invalid key data, or `holderDID` is set without `holderKeyRef`. | Verify the holder key Secret exists and contains a valid ECDSA P-256 private key under the `key.pem` or `tls.key` data key. If using `holderDID`, ensure `holderKeyRef` is also set. |

### Credential not renewing

**Symptom:** The credential expires without being renewed.

1. Check `status.nextRenewalTime` on the `VerifiableCredentialRequest`:
   ```bash
   kubectl get vcr <name> -o jsonpath='{.status.nextRenewalTime}'
   ```
2. Check operator logs for renewal errors:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n vc-operator-system deployment/vc-operator-controller-manager
   ```
3. Ensure the `renewBefore` duration is less than the credential's lifetime.

### View operator events

```bash
kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=CredentialIssuer
kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=VerifiableCredentialRequest
```
